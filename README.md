#Day61 of #100DaysChallenge

Just made this simple landing page today by using Tailwind CSS

tbh the plan was to do this yesterday, but I got so tired with another work that I ended up creating it this morning. Sorry for the punctuality hiccup! üëç

The website has a vintage vibe with a touch of traditional elements to keep it engaging and fun.

I got the design from Dribbble.com.You can find a lot of nice and beautiful designs there it's a great resource for inspiration

Let's keep pushing forward ‚ö°Ô∏è
